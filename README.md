# The White House Staff Quiz (homework #4)
This project is intended as a fun quiz for the newly-minted junior White House Staffer or simply a politics and government enthusiast. The user is presented with a series of questions to test their knowledge of key White House staffers, cabinet officers, and Executive Office of the President (EOP) operations. The user is only given 60 seconds, and is penalized with reduced time for every wrong answer. It should be noted that the answers are selected via multiple choice, but the verbosity of the queries admittedly makes reading them time-consuming.
